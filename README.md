## Introduction

Bike-sharing services generate vast amounts of data that can be analyzed to predict demand based on various factors like season, weather, and working days. This project uses **machine learning** to forecast bike rentals and provides an **API** to serve predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset ([Download Here](https://your-dataset-link.com)) contains features such as:

- **dteday**: Date of rental.
- **season**: (1: Spring, 2: Summer, 3: Fall, 4: Winter).
- **yr**: Year (0: 2011, 1: 2012).
- **mnth**: Month (1-12).
- **holiday**: Is it a holiday? (0: No, 1: Yes).
- **weekday**: Day of the week (0: Sunday - 6: Saturday).
- **workingday**: Is it a working day? (0: No, 1: Yes).
- **weathersit**: (1: Clear, 2: Misty, 3: Light Rain/Snow, 4: Heavy Rain/Snow).
- **temp**: Normalized temperature.
- **atemp**: Normalized feeling temperature.
- **hum**: Normalized humidity.
- **windspeed**: Normalized wind speed.
- **rentals**: Number of bike rentals.

## Machine Learning Models

Several models were trained and evaluated:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **XGBoost**

The best-performing model is deployed via **Flask**.

## Model Training

Model training is detailed in `ml-implementation.ipynb`, covering:

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Model Training & Evaluation
- Hyperparameter Tuning

# API Endpoints

## `GET /`
Renders the home page.

## `POST /predict`
Accepts a JSON object with input features and returns predicted bike demand.

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"season": 1, "yr": 0, "mnth": 1, "holiday": 0, "weekday": 6, "workingday": 0, "weathersit": 2, "temp": 0.344, "atemp": 0.364, "hum": 0.806, "windspeed": 0.160}' http://localhost:5000/predict
